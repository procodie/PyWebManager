## You all have seen Ruby on Rails now get ready for python on pails.
#### So what is Python on Pails?
Q: Is it something like Ruby on Rails ,but in python?\
Answer :No Idea(Maybe). Never used Rails. All I can say is this program is a "framework wannabe".

# ⚠This is V2.0 (Still Under Delvelopment)⚠
## Please Checkout v1 branch for Stable Framework


##### [Visit Official Website for more Information](https://tg21.github.io)
- Python-On-Pails(PyOP) is just a simple "kind of a framework" programmed in python. It is cool and it also  eliminates the need to install apache2, xampp ,wamp or lamp on systems that already have python(Python3 to be precise) installed.
- PyOP can use python3 as the main server side language.
.

# Why Make it?
Currently most developer use flask or django as frameworks for web-development with python.\
But I found that Django has a steep learning curve, You can't just use it to build web-applications after learning python, you have to watch and read tutorials on Django too.\
same case exists with flask too. So, I wanted to make a framework anybody who has working knowledge of python could use to create Web-Apps.


## How is it different from version 1.
 - For starters, version 2 of PyOP will be based on MVC.
 - And Many more features which I will list once they are implemented.

### TODOs

 - Add easy routes feature (DONE).
 - Add a GUI for to start and manage server
 - package for pypi
 - Easy TLS encryption
 - Make things like cookies and $_SERVER kind of thing available
 - find and better name and logo for this project(LOGO done and love project name so not gonna change it now).
 - Make server understand inline python code from html files (DONE).

### Installation
PyOP requires [python3](https://www.python.org/) to run.

add your project files in www folder.\
run server.py to start the server.\
all files presnent in www folder will be served to client.


```sh
$ cd python-on-pails
$ sudo python3 server.py
```

For production environments...

```sh
do the same as above but at your own risk.
```
