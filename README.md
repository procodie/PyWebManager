## You all have seen Ruby on Rails now get ready for python on pails.
#### So what is Python on Pails?
Q: Is it something like Ruby on Rails ,but in python?\
Previous Answer : No Idea(Maybe). Never used Rails. All I can say is this program is a "framework wannabe".\
Current Answer : I think so. Still haven't used Rails.

# ⚠This is V2.0 (Still Under Delvelopment)⚠
## Please Checkout v1 branch for Stable Framework


## Our Philosphy
Spend your time writing your business logic rather than writing server.

## Why PyOP?
- No additional dependencies just Vanilla python3.
- Python-On-Pails(PyOP) is just a simple "kind of a framework" programmed in python. It is cool and it also  eliminates the need to install apache2, xampp ,wamp or lamp on systems that already have python(Python3 to be precise) installed.
- PyOP can use python3 as the main server side language.
- PyOP is like a ready-to-deploy framework. everything is already setup for you. You only need to write your business logic.
- modifying behaviour of server does not require writing more code, simple changes to server/settings.py is enough.

## How is it different from version 1.
 - For starters, version 2 of PyOP will be based on MVC.
 - And Many more features which I will list once they are implemented.
 - Automatic type casting.
 - changed error responses to tackle information gathering attacks from softwares like nmap.
